# 3Ball_Golf_Tracker
Technologies: Python, Selenium, HTML, CSS
App to sort current golf leaderboard by playing groups. Allows users to sort by groups, favorite groups, favorite players, and get real time updates to PGA Scores.  Displays scores in color coded fashion to quickly tell which player is winning their group, scrapes the PGA leaderboard website periodically during tournaments to update database.

At the moment using CSV instead of Database, will finish integrating to DB once scraping issues are fixed.
Currently not working - PGA dynamic webpage has changed + issues with Selenium.
